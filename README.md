    *   **API Gateway (`backend/xmrt-unified-backend/`)**
        *   **Purpose**: Acts as the central entry point for all frontend requests, routing them to the appropriate backend services. It handles authentication, authorization, and rate limiting, providing a unified and secure API for the frontend.
        *   **Integration**: Connects the frontend to all other backend services and smart contracts.

    *   **AI Automation Service (`backend/ai-automation-service/`)**
        *   **Purpose**: Houses the core AI logic for autonomous DAO operations, including Eliza AI. This service is responsible for decision-making, task execution, and system monitoring.
        *   **Key Sub-components**: 
            *   `autonomous_eliza.py`: Contains the main Eliza OS implementation, now enhanced with dynamic confidence adjustment, multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), and Explainable AI (XAI) capabilities. It allows Eliza to make more informed and transparent decisions.
            *   `self_monitoring.py`: A newly implemented comprehensive self-monitoring system that tracks system health, performance, and AI decision quality. It includes resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk), blockchain health checks, and an alert system with persistence to an SQLite database. This ensures the continuous operational health of the autonomous system.
            *   `github_integration.py`: A critical component enabling Eliza to autonomously analyze, improve, and commit code changes directly to the GitHub repository. It can identify potential improvements (code quality, security, performance, documentation, testing), propose changes, and even auto-merge low-risk, high-confidence improvements via pull requests. This is a significant step towards self-improving AI.
            *   `autonomous_improvement_engine.py`: Works in conjunction with `github_integration.py` to drive the autonomous improvement cycles, analyzing the codebase and suggesting enhancements.

        *   **Integration**: Directly interfaces with the smart contracts layer.

    *   **Cross-Chain Service (`backend/cross-chain-service/`)**
        *   **Purpose**: Facilitates seamless multi-blockchain operations, enabling governance decisions and asset transfers across different networks.
        *   **Integration**: Works with `CrossChainExecutor.sol` and external bridge protocols like Wormhole/LayerZero.

    *   **ZK Service (`backend/zk-service/`)**
        *   **Purpose**: Provides zero-knowledge proof functionality for enhanced privacy and verifiable computations within the DAO.
        *   **Integration**: Interacts with `ZKPVerifier.sol` for on-chain proof verification.

3.  **Smart Contracts (`contracts/`)**
    The smart contract layer forms the immutable backbone of the DAO, defining its rules and functionalities. All contracts are upgradeable (UUPS pattern) and adhere to high security standards.

    *   **`Governance.sol`**: The main orchestration contract, now refined to include advanced AI agent management features, integrating with `AIAgentRegistry.sol`.
    *   **`DAO_Governance.sol`**: Handles comprehensive governance with proposal creation, voting, and execution. It now dynamically fetches parameters from `ParameterRegistry.sol`.
    *   **`DAO_Treasury.sol`**: Manages multi-asset treasury with AI agent spending limits, integrating with `PolicyEngine.sol`.
    *   **`XMRT.sol`**: The native token contract, with governable parameters.
    *   **`ParameterRegistry.sol`**: Centralizes governable parameters, allowing the DAO to dynamically update key configurations.
    *   **`PolicyEngine.sol`**: Defines and enforces AI agent spending limits and other operational rules.
    *   **`AI_Agent_Interface.sol`**: A dedicated interface for AI agents to interact with the DAO, enabling them to create proposals and execute spending within defined policies.
    *   **`ZKPVerifier.sol`**: Enables on-chain verification of zero-knowledge proofs for private voting and verifiable off-chain computations.
    *   **`CrossChainExecutor.sol`**: Facilitates cross-chain governance execution by interacting with bridge protocols.
    *   **`AIAgentRegistry.sol`**: A newly introduced contract for comprehensive AI agent management, including registration, role assignment, status tracking, and a reputation system.

### Testing and Security Infrastructure

*   **Comprehensive Test Suite**: The `test/` directory contains extensive unit and integration tests (`DAO_Integration_Test.sol`, `Governance.test.js`, `autonomous_dao_test.js`) to ensure the correctness and robustness of all smart contracts and system functionalities.
*   **Security Audits**: An internal `security_audit_report.md` has been conducted, identifying and addressing high-priority issues like reentrancy and access control. Medium and low-priority issues, such as time-based vulnerabilities and gas optimization, have been identified with recommendations for further improvement. The system is designed for auditability and prepares for external audits.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline**: A robust GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline ensures automated testing, linting, and deployment readiness, maintaining high code quality and rapid iteration cycles.

### Autonomous Capabilities and Self-Improvement

The ecosystem is designed to be highly autonomous, with Eliza AI at its core. The `ai-automation-service` is the brain, enabling:

*   **Autonomous Decision Making**: Eliza can analyze proposals, evaluate risks, and make decisions based on defined criteria and confidence levels.
*   **Self-Monitoring**: The system continuously monitors its own health, performance, and the quality of AI decisions, triggering alerts and emergency protocols when necessary.
*   **Self-Improvement**: Through `github_integration.py` and `autonomous_improvement_engine.py`, Eliza can analyze its own codebase, identify areas for improvement, propose and implement code changes, and even manage pull requests. This recursive self-improvement capability is a cornerstone of the XMRT-Ecosystem's long-term vision.
*   **Meta-Learning**: The `self_improvement_meta_system.py` allows the AI to learn from its own improvement processes, optimizing its strategies for future enhancements.
*   **Orchestration**: The `integration_orchestrator.py` ensures that all these complex autonomous processes run harmoniously, managing resources, resolving conflicts, and maintaining overall system stability.

### Conclusion on Ecosystem Structure

Overall, the XMRT-Ecosystem presents a well-structured, modular, and highly autonomous platform. The integration of AI capabilities across monitoring, decision-making, and self-improvement, coupled with a robust smart contract architecture and comprehensive testing, positions it as a leading example of a truly intelligent DAO. The current structure is comprehensive and designed for continuous evolution and resilience, with clear pathways for further enhancements as outlined in the `missing_logic_and_plan.md` and `todo.md` documents.





## 🐍 Python Web Service Deployment (Render)

This section outlines the steps to deploy the newly added Python web service to Render.

### Project Structure

The Python web service is located in the `python_service/` directory at the root of the repository. The main application file is `python_service/main.py`.

### Dependencies

All Python dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` at the root of the repository. These will be automatically installed by Render during deployment.

### Running the Enhanced Autonomous System (v3.0)

To run the new **master-level autonomous system** with 95%+ autonomy:

1.  Navigate to the `XMRT-Ecosystem` directory:
    ```bash
    cd XMRT-Ecosystem
    ```
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Run the enhanced autonomous system:
    ```bash
    python3 main_enhanced.py
    ```
    The enhanced dashboard will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Running the Service Locally (Legacy)

To run the Flask application locally using Gunicorn:

1.  Navigate to the `XMRT-Ecosystem` directory:
    ```bash
    cd XMRT-Ecosystem
    ```
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Run the Gunicorn server:
    ```bash
    gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 python_service.main:app
    ```
    The service will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Render Deployment Configuration

Render automatically detects the `Procfile` at the root of the repository to determine how to run your application. The `Procfile` for this service is configured as:

```
web: gunicorn python_service.main:app
```

### Environment Variables (Crucial for Smart Contract Interaction)

For the Python web service to interact with the Ethereum network and your smart contracts, you **MUST** configure the following environment variables on Render:

*   `INFURA_URL`: Your Infura (or other Ethereum node provider) URL. This is used by `web3.py` to connect to the blockchain.
*   `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of the Ethereum account that will be used to send transactions (e.g., for `setValue` function calls). **Exercise extreme caution with this variable in production environments.** Consider using Render's secret management or other secure key management solutions.
*   `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: The address of your deployed smart contract on the Ethereum network.

### Smart Contract ABI (`abi.json`)

The `python_service/abi.json` file contains the Application Binary Interface (ABI) of your smart contract. This file is essential for `web3.py` to understand how to interact with your contract's functions. **You must replace the placeholder content in `abi.json` with the actual ABI of your deployed XMRT smart contract.** You can obtain the ABI when you compile your Solidity contracts.

### Next Steps for Deployment on Render

1.  Log in to your Render account.
2.  Create a new Web Service.
3.  Connect your GitHub repository (`DevGruGold/XMRT-Ecosystem`).
4.  Render should automatically detect the Python project and suggest a build command (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`) and start command (e.g., `gunicorn python_service.main:app`).
5.  **Crucially, add the environment variables (`INFURA_URL`, `PRIVATE_KEY`, `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`) in Render's settings for your web service.**
6.  Deploy the service.

After successful deployment, your Python web service will be live and ready to interact with your XMRT smart contracts.
