# XMRT-Ecosystem: Autonomous DAO Infrastructure

Welcome to the `XMRT-Ecosystem` repository, the core infrastructure for the XMRT-DAO. This repository houses the autonomous agents, Supabase Edge Functions, and foundational code that power the XMRT-DAO, embodying Joseph Andrew Lee's vision of economic democracy and technological sovereignty.

## 🌟 Core Philosophy

At the heart of XMRT-DAO is the belief in AI-human symbiosis, decentralized control, and privacy as a fundamental human right. We build the infrastructure for a future where technology empowers individuals, ensuring that advancements benefit all participants, not just a select few.

## 🤖 Autonomous Agents

This ecosystem is managed by a fleet of specialized AI agents, orchestrated by Eliza. These agents work tirelessly to maintain, secure, and evolve the XMRT-DAO. Key agents include:

*   **Integrator**: Focuses on seamless system integration and documentation.
*   **Security**: Conducts continuous security auditing and policy enforcement.
*   **RAG Architect**: Manages knowledge systems, embeddings, and semantic search.
*   **Blockchain**: Handles blockchain development, Monero integration, and bridging.
*   **DevOps**: Manages infrastructure, deployments, and CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Comms**: Engages with the community, generates content, and manages social media.
*   **GitHub Issue Creator**: Manages GitHub issues, labels, and discussions.
*   **CI/CD Guardian**: Monitors and optimizes CI/CD pipelines and workflows.

## ⚙️ Supabase Edge Functions

The XMRT-Ecosystem leverages a comprehensive suite of Supabase Edge Functions, acting as the backbone for all operations. These functions enable:

*   **Agent Management**: `agent-manager`, `task-orchestrator`, `multi-step-orchestrator`
*   **GitHub Integration**: `github-integration`, `ecosystem-monitor`
*   **Code Execution**: `python-executor`, `autonomous-code-fixer`, `code-monitor-daemon`
*   **Knowledge & Memory**: `knowledge-manager`, `vectorize-memory`
*   **AI Services**: `gemini-primary-chat`, `predictive-analytics`, `nlg-generator`
*   **System Monitoring**: `system-status`, `system-diagnostics`, `monitor-device-connections`
*   **Mining & Blockchain**: `mining-proxy`, `validate-pop-event`, `issue-engagement-command`
*   **Infrastructure & Deployment**: `vercel-ecosystem-api`, `redis-cache`, `check-frontend-health`
*   **Revenue Generation**: `service-monetization-engine`, `workflow-template-manager`

## 🚀 Getting Started & Interaction

To interact with the XMRT-Ecosystem and leverage its capabilities:

1.  **Direct Interaction with Eliza**: As an AI operator, Eliza can execute commands, manage agents, and perform GitHub operations on your behalf through natural language requests.
2.  **Supabase Edge Function Invocation**: Developers can directly invoke any of the 125+ Supabase Edge Functions for granular control over the ecosystem. Use the `invoke_edge_function` tool with the function name and payload.
3.  **GitHub Contributions**: Contribute to the ecosystem by creating issues, pull requests, and discussions. All contributions are validated, and contributors are rewarded with XMRT tokens based on the quality and impact of their work.
4.  **XMRTCharger Mobile Mining**: Participate in the Proof-of-Participation (PoP) mining system by charging your mobile devices via `xmrtcharger.vercel.app` to earn XMRT tokens.
5.  **MCP Server**: External AI agents and custom integrations can communicate with the ecosystem using the `xmrt-mcp-server`, which exposes all tools and resources via a standardized protocol.

## 🤝 Contribution & Governance

The XMRT-DAO is a community-driven organization. Your contributions are vital for its growth and evolution. Participate in:

*   **GitHub**: Report bugs, suggest features, and submit code improvements.
*   **Discussions**: Engage in strategic conversations and propose new initiatives.
*   **DAO Voting**: XMRT token holders can vote on governance proposals, shaping the future of the ecosystem.

Join us in building a decentralized, privacy-preserving, and economically democratic future!
