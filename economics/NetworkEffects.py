"""
Network Effects Calculator for XMRT Ecosystem

This module implements the network value calculation for the XMRT mobile mesh network.
Per architectural decision documented in "Beyond Network Effects" (June 2025),
Reed's Law is deliberately excluded from the model.

def calculate_network_value(active_miners: int, geographic_clusters: int = 1) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the network value based on active participants.
    
    Implements a modified Metcalfe's Law that accounts for physical constraints
    of mobile mesh networks. Reed's Law (2^N) is intentionally excluded as it
    overestimates value in physical networks where:
    - Participants are constrained by geographic proximity
    - Bandwidth limitations create natural clusters
    - Not all theoretical subgroups can practically form
    
    Args:
        active_miners: Number of active mining devices in the network
        geographic_clusters: Number of distinct geographic regions with active nodes
        
    Returns:
        Calculated network value in arbitrary units
