# Decentralized Identity Management System

**Idea**: A secure and user-friendly decentralized identity management platform that allows users to create, manage, and share their identities across various services within the XMRT ecosystem using blockchain technology.

**Rationale**: This feature enhances user privacy and control over personal data, addressing growing concerns about data security and identity theft.

**Tags**: identity, privacy, blockchain, decentralization

Created by the XMRT multi-agent consensus flow.
Next steps:
- Wire into MobileMonero / MeshNet / Optimizer as applicable.
