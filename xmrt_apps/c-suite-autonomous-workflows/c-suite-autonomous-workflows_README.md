# C-Suite Autonomous Workflows for Eliza

**Idea**: A set of n8n workflows integrated into the XMRT Ecosystem to grant Eliza C-suite level autonomous capabilities. This includes advanced data querying, strategic memory management, and multi-agent orchestration.

**Rationale**: To elevate Eliza's role from an assistant to a fully autonomous executive, capable of strategic decision-making and complex task execution, as requested by the user.

**Key Workflows Integrated**:
1.  **AI Agent Chatbot + LONG TERM Memory + Note Storage**: Provides Eliza with persistent memory for strategic context and long-term planning.
2.  **Multi-AI Agent Chatbot for Postgres/Supabase DB and QuickCharts + Tool Router**: Enables Eliza to perform complex data analysis, query the ecosystem's database (Supabase/Postgres), and generate data visualizations (QuickCharts) for executive reporting.

**Tags**: c-suite, eliza, autonomous-agent, n8n, strategy, data-analysis

Next steps:
- Integrate the n8n workflow JSON files into the repository structure.
- Update the XMRT-Ecosystem's agent orchestration logic to expose these new capabilities to Eliza.
- Add tests and integration hooks.
