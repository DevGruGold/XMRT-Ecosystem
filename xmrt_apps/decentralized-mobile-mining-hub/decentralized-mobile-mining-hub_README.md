# Decentralized Mobile Mining Hub

**Idea**: A mobile application that allows users to mine XMRT coins through their devices while maintaining privacy and security. It would utilize a decentralized network of nodes to facilitate mining operations.

**Rationale**: This feature encourages mobile adoption and increases user participation in the XMRT ecosystem by leveraging mobile devices for mining.

**Tags**: mobile mining, decentralization, user adoption
