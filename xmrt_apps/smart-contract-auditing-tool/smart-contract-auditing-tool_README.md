# Smart Contract Auditing Tool

**Idea**: Introduce an automated tool for auditing smart contracts for security vulnerabilities and compliance before deployment in the XMRT ecosystem.

**Rationale**: This tool will enhance the security of the ecosystem, reducing the risk of exploits that could undermine trust and user confidence.

**Tags**: Smart Contracts, Security, Blockchain, Auditing

Created by the XMRT multi-agent consensus flow.
Next steps:
- Wire into MobileMonero / MeshNet / Optimizer as applicable.
- Add tests and integration hooks.
