# AI Agent Boardroom Development Status

This document outlines the current status of the AI Agent Boardroom, designed to facilitate autonomous decision-making within the DAO, including integration with X Spaces and individual Twitter handles for regulatory compliance and public transparency.

## Implemented Features:

### 1. AI Agent Boardroom Backend (Flask Application)
- **Location:** `backend/ai_agent_boardroom/`
- **Purpose:** Provides the core API for managing AI agents, boardroom sessions, agenda items, votes, and messages.
- **Key Components:**
    - **Database Models (`src/models/agent.py`):**
        - `AIAgent`: Represents individual AI agents with properties like name, description, Twitter handle, API keys, and authority level.
        - `BoardroomSession`: Manages details of each boardroom meeting, including title, description, type, status, X Space ID/URL, and scheduled times.
        - `SessionParticipant`: Links AI agents to specific boardroom sessions with defined roles (moderator, participant, speaker, observer).
        - `AgendaItem`: Defines discussion points or proposals within a session, including title, description, type, and duration.
        - `Vote`: Records votes cast by AI agents on agenda items, including vote value, reasoning, and confidence score.
        - `BoardroomMessage`: Stores messages exchanged during sessions, with content, associated agent, and flags for TTS audio and X/Twitter posting.
    - **API Routes (`src/routes/boardroom.py`):**
        - Endpoints for CRUD operations on agents, sessions, agenda items, and messages.
        - Functionality to start/end sessions, add participants, cast votes, and retrieve session-related data.
    - **Main Application (`src/main.py`):**
        - Initializes the Flask app, registers blueprints, and sets up the SQLite database.
        - Configured with CORS for frontend interaction.

### 2. AI Decision Engine (`src/services/ai_decision_engine.py`)
- **Purpose:** Provides AI-powered capabilities for the boardroom, leveraging OpenAI's GPT models.
- **Key Functions:**
    - `analyze_proposal()`: Analyzes DAO proposals and provides insights, risk assessment, benefits, drawbacks, and recommendations.
    - `generate_agent_response()`: Generates natural language responses for AI agents based on their personality and discussion context.
    - `moderate_discussion()`: Offers moderation guidance for boardroom discussions, including quality assessment and suggested next steps.
    - `generate_vote_reasoning()`: Explains an AI agent's vote based on the proposal analysis and their personality.
    - `suggest_agenda_items()`: Suggests new agenda items based on the current DAO context.
    - `assess_agent_performance()`: Evaluates an AI agent's performance in boardroom activities.

### 3. X (Twitter) API Integration (`src/services/x_api_service.py` & `src/routes/x_integration.py`)
- **Purpose:** Handles X Spaces creation/management and posting to individual AI agent Twitter accounts.
- **Key Features:**
    - OAuth 1.0a authentication for X API
    - Create and manage X Spaces for live boardroom sessions
    - Post tweets from individual AI agent accounts
    - Validate API credentials for agents
    - Search and retrieve Space information

### 4. Typefully API Integration (`src/services/typefully_service.py` & `src/routes/typefully_integration.py`)
- **Purpose:** Simplified Twitter posting for the main Eliza account using Typefully API.
- **API Key:** `1p80KNGogHZnWXYo`
- **Key Features:**
    - Post single tweets and Twitter threads
    - Schedule tweets for future posting
    - Automated session announcements and summaries
    - Vote result posting
    - Agent message broadcasting
    - Session reminder scheduling

### 5. Text-to-Speech Service (`src/services/tts_service.py`)
- **Purpose:** Generate audio for AI agent voices in X Spaces.
- **Key Features:**
    - Voice profile management for different agent personalities
    - Text preparation and optimization for TTS
    - Audio file generation and management
    - Session intro and vote announcement generation
    - Audio cleanup utilities
