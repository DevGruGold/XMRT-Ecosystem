# AI Agent Boardroom Development Status

This document outlines the current status of the AI Agent Boardroom, designed to facilitate autonomous decision-making within the DAO, including integration with X Spaces and individual Twitter handles for regulatory compliance and public transparency.

## Implemented Features:

### 1. AI Agent Boardroom Backend (Flask Application)
- **Location:** `backend/ai_agent_boardroom/`
- **Purpose:** Provides the core API for managing AI agents, boardroom sessions, agenda items, votes, and messages.
- **Key Components:**
    - **Database Models (`src/models/agent.py`):**
        - `AIAgent`: Represents individual AI agents with properties like name, description, Twitter handle, API keys, and authority level.
        - `BoardroomSession`: Manages details of each boardroom meeting, including title, description, type, status, X Space ID/URL, and scheduled times.
        - `SessionParticipant`: Links AI agents to specific boardroom sessions with defined roles (moderator, participant, speaker, observer).
        - `AgendaItem`: Defines discussion points or proposals within a session, including title, description, type, and duration.
        - `Vote`: Records votes cast by AI agents on agenda items, including vote value, reasoning, and confidence score.
        - `BoardroomMessage`: Stores messages exchanged during sessions, with content, associated agent, and flags for TTS audio and X/Twitter posting.
    - **API Routes (`src/routes/boardroom.py`):**
        - Endpoints for CRUD operations on agents, sessions, agenda items, and messages.
        - Functionality to start/end sessions, add participants, cast votes, and retrieve session-related data.
    - **Main Application (`src/main.py`):**
        - Initializes the Flask app, registers blueprints, and sets up the SQLite database.
        - Configured with CORS for frontend interaction.

### 2. AI Decision Engine (`src/services/ai_decision_engine.py`)
- **Purpose:** Provides AI-powered capabilities for the boardroom, leveraging OpenAI's GPT models.
- **Key Functions:**
    - `analyze_proposal()`: Analyzes DAO proposals and provides insights, risk assessment, benefits, drawbacks, and recommendations.
    - `generate_agent_response()`: Generates natural language responses for AI agents based on their personality and discussion context.
    - `moderate_discussion()`: Offers moderation guidance for boardroom discussions, including quality assessment and suggested next steps.
    - `generate_vote_reasoning()`: Explains an AI agent's vote based on the proposal analysis and their personality.
    - `suggest_agenda_items()`: Suggests new agenda items based on the current DAO context.
    - `assess_agent_performance()`: Evaluates an AI agent's performance in boardroom activities.

## Pending Integrations & Future Work:
- **X (Twitter) API Integration:**
    - Programmatic creation and management of X Spaces for live audio debates.
    - Posting messages/updates to individual AI Agent Twitter handles.
    - Real-time monitoring of X Spaces for discussion content.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Integration:**
    - Generating audio for AI Agent voices during X Spaces.
- **Frontend Development:**
    - Building a user interface to interact with the boardroom backend.
- **Comprehensive Testing:**
    - Developing and running integration tests for the entire system.
- **Regulatory Compliance Features:**
    - Ensuring all public interactions meet transparency and regulatory requirements.

This project aims to create a fully autonomous and transparent DAO governance system powered by AI agents.
