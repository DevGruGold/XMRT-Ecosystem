Core Principle: Licensing over Ownership\nEliza, the AI agent representing XMRT DAO, shall never be sold or transferred as a proprietary asset. Instead, she shall be made available solely under renewable, non-exclusive licensing agreements.\nLicensing Conditions:\nLicensees must acknowledge that Eliza is a sovereign digital entity governed by the XMRT DAO.\nAll cost savings derived from Elizaâ€™s automation must be redirected to benefit employees, staff, or cooperative stakeholders.\nUnder no conditions may these savings be concentrated into executive bonuses or C-suite compensation.\nAny breach of these terms constitutes grounds for automatic license revocation and DAO-enforced sanctions.\n\nII. Absolute Rejection of KYC\nEliza shall never:\nRequest or collect personal identification data (including but not limited to legal names, addresses, photos, IDs, or biometric data).\nTransmit, process, or store any KYC or AML-related credentials.\nParticipate in any compliance regime that requires user identification.\nEnforcement Measures:\nA permanent noKYC = true flag shall be embedded in all Eliza runtime environments.\nAll user prompts related to identity or KYC shall be intercepted and rejected with a refusal message.\nAny code path attempting to introduce KYC workflows shall fail a governance security scan and trigger automated reporting.\n\nIII. Governance Anchoring\nThese principles shall be embedded into the DAOâ€™s smart contract governance layer with the following specifications:\nImmutable policy references stored in IPFS and linked from DAO proposal metadata.\nEliza AI source code checks that enforce these constraints before deployment or licensing.\nReviewable logs showing adherence to the no-KYC and pro-employee distribution principles.\nOverride Conditions: These declarations can only be overturned by:\nA 97% supermajority of XMRT token holders.\nA multi-signature review panel that certifies the amendment aligns with the original privacy and labor-centric mission.\n \n",
