## Todo List

### Phase 1: Setup GitHub API access and clone repository
- [x] Set GitHub PAT as environment variable
- [x] Clone the GitHub repository

### Phase 2: Analyze existing smart contracts and DAO structure
- [x] List contents of the repository
- [x] Read Governance.sol
- [x] Read Vault.sol
- [x] Read XMRT.sol
- [x] Read GovernanceProxy.sol
- [x] Read GovernanceUpgrade.sol
- [x] Read XMRTCrossChain.sol
- [x] Read XMRTLayerZeroOFT.sol
- [x] Read ARCHITECTURE.md
- [x] Summarize findings and identify missing logic for complete DAO automation.

### Phase 3: Identify missing logic and create implementation plan
- [x] Detail the missing components and functionalities required for full DAO automation.
- [x] Outline the smart contracts and modifications needed.
- [x] Create a high-level implementation plan.

### Phase 4: Implement missing smart contracts and logic
- [x] Write DAO_Governance.sol - comprehensive governance contract with proposal creation, voting, and execution
- [x] Write DAO_Treasury.sol - enhanced treasury management with multi-asset support and AI agent spending limits
- [x] Update Governance.sol - main orchestration contract with AI agent registration and management
- [x] Update Vault.sol - legacy contract that now acts as proxy to DAO_Treasury
- [x] Write AI_Agent_Interface.sol - dedicated interface for AI agents to interact with DAO
- [x] Write comprehensive test suite for DAO integration
- [ ] Commit and push all new and modified code to the repository.

### Phase 5: Push changes to GitHub repository
- [ ] Commit and push all new and modified code to the repository.

### Phase 6: Deliver analysis report and implementation summary
- [ ] Prepare a comprehensive report detailing the analysis, implemented changes, and future recommendations.
- [ ] Provide a summary of the work done and how it contributes to full DAO automation.

### Phase 7: Core Governance Enhancements & AI Agent Management
- [ ] Refine `Governance.sol` to include more advanced AI agent management features (dynamic roles, lifecycle management).
- [ ] Implement a mechanism for the DAO to vote on and update key governance parameters (e.g., voting period, quorum) within `DAO_Governance.sol`.
- [ ] Create a `ParameterRegistry.sol` contract to centralize governable parameters.

### Phase 8: Advanced Treasury & Multi-Asset Management
- [ ] Modify `DAO_Treasury.sol` to support ERC20 tokens and potentially NFTs.
- [ ] Develop `PolicyEngine.sol` to define and enforce AI agent spending limits and policies.
- [ ] Integrate `PolicyEngine.sol` with `DAO_Treasury.sol` and `Governance.sol`.

### Phase 9: Cross-Chain & ZKP Integration
- [ ] Develop `CrossChainExecutor.sol` to interact with Wormhole/LayerZero for cross-chain governance.
- [ ] Implement `ZKPVerifier.sol` for on-chain verification of ZK proofs.
- [ ] Integrate ZKP verification into the voting process for private voting.

### Phase 10: Comprehensive Testing & Security Audits
- [ ] Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests for all new functionalities.
- [ ] Conduct internal security audits and prepare for external audits.

### Phase 11: Documentation & Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Update `README.md`, `agents.md`, and `ARCHITECTURE.md` with the new features.
- [ ] Prepare deployment scripts and instructions.
