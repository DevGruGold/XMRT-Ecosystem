# XMRTNET Smart Contract Architecture Outline

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the proposed smart contract architecture for XMRTNET, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on Starknet. The architecture aims to provide a robust, secure, and scalable foundation for various DeFi functionalities, including token management, staking, and future extensions. Leveraging Starknet's ZK-Rollup technology, the contracts will benefit from enhanced scalability and lower transaction costs while maintaining Ethereum's security guarantees.

## 2. Core Components

The XMRTNET smart contract ecosystem will consist of several interconnected core components, each responsible for a specific set of functionalities. This modular approach enhances security, simplifies upgrades, and promotes reusability.

### 2.1. XMRT Token Contract

This will be the foundational token for the XMRTNET ecosystem. It will be an ERC-20 compliant token implemented in Cairo. Key features will include:

*   **Standard ERC-20 functionalities:** `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`, `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`.
*   **Minting and Burning:** Controlled mechanisms for the creation and destruction of XMRT tokens, likely managed by a governance contract or a multi-signature wallet.
*   **Access Control:** Implementation of roles (e.g., minter, pauser) to manage critical functions, ensuring only authorized entities can perform sensitive operations.

### 2.2. Staking Contract

The staking contract will enable users to lock their XMRT tokens for a specified period to earn rewards. This contract will be designed to be flexible and potentially support different staking models (e.g., fixed-term, flexible).

*   **Deposit Functionality:** Allows users to deposit XMRT tokens into the staking pool.
*   **Withdrawal Functionality:** Enables users to withdraw their staked tokens and accumulated rewards after the staking period or under specific conditions.
*   **Reward Distribution:** Mechanisms for calculating and distributing staking rewards, potentially based on factors like staked amount, staking duration, and overall pool performance.
*   **Slashing (Optional):** Consideration for implementing slashing mechanisms to penalize malicious behavior or non-compliance with staking rules.

### 2.3. Governance Contract (Future Consideration)

While not part of the initial deployment, a governance contract will be a crucial future component for achieving full autonomy and decentralization. This contract would allow XMRT token holders to propose, vote on, and implement changes to the protocol.

*   **Proposal Submission:** Enables users to submit proposals for protocol upgrades, parameter changes, or new feature integrations.
*   **Voting Mechanism:** Allows token holders to vote on submitted proposals, with voting power proportional to their XMRT holdings.
*   **Execution:** A mechanism to automatically or manually execute approved proposals.

### 2.4. Treasury Contract (Future Consideration)

A dedicated treasury contract would manage funds collected from protocol fees, staking rewards, or other revenue streams. This contract would be controlled by the governance mechanism.

*   **Fund Management:** Securely holds and manages protocol assets.
*   **Disbursement:** Allows for controlled disbursement of funds for development, grants, or other community initiatives as approved by governance.

## 3. Architectural Considerations

### 3.1. Modularity

Each core component will be developed as a separate, independent contract. This modularity offers several advantages:

*   **Reduced Complexity:** Easier to develop, audit, and maintain individual contracts.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Isolates vulnerabilities; a bug in one contract is less likely to affect the entire system.
*   **Upgradeability:** Allows for individual contracts to be upgraded or replaced without affecting the entire protocol, crucial for long-term sustainability on Starknet.

### 3.2. Upgradeability

Starknet contracts support upgradeability through proxy patterns. We will utilize a proxy pattern (e.g., Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard - UUPS) to ensure that contracts can be upgraded to fix bugs, add new features, or improve efficiency without migrating user funds or data.

### 3.3. Access Control and Permissions

Robust access control mechanisms will be implemented using roles and permissions. This ensures that only authorized addresses or contracts can call sensitive functions (e.g., minting tokens, pausing contracts).

### 3.4. Event Emission

All significant state changes and actions within the contracts will emit events. This is crucial for off-chain monitoring, indexing, and building responsive user interfaces.

### 3.5. Error Handling

Contracts will include comprehensive error handling to provide clear and informative error messages, aiding in debugging and user experience.

## 4. Interaction Flow (High-Level)

1.  **User connects wallet:** Frontend uses `get-starknet` to connect to a Starknet-compatible wallet (e.g., Argent X, Braavos).
2.  **User interacts with frontend:** Frontend calls functions on the deployed XMRTNET smart contracts.
3.  **Wallet signs transaction:** The user's wallet signs the transaction, which is then sent to the Starknet network.
4.  **Starknet processes transaction:** The transaction is executed on Starknet, updating the state of the relevant contracts.
5.  **Frontend updates:** Frontend listens for contract events and updates the UI to reflect the new state.

## 5. Future Enhancements

*   **Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Integration:** Integration with or development of a DEX for XMRT token trading.
*   **Lending and Borrowing:** Introduction of lending and borrowing protocols using XMRT as collateral or for interest.
*   **Yield Farming:** Additional mechanisms for users to earn yield on their XMRT tokens.
*   **Cross-Chain Bridges:** Exploration of bridges to other blockchain networks to enhance interoperability.

## 6. Conclusion

This architectural outline provides a roadmap for developing the XMRTNET smart contracts on Starknet. By focusing on modularity, security, and upgradeability, we aim to build a resilient and future-proof DeFi platform. The next steps involve detailed design and implementation of each contract component in Cairo.
